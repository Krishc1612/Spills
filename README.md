## 🤝 Frontend Collaboration

The frontend is not implemented yet.

Looking for a **frontend developer (React / UI)** to collaborate and build:
- Forms for medicine scheduling
- Dashboards for reminders and logs
- Charts for adherence analytics
- Simple, clean user interface on top of existing APIs

If you’re interested, feel free to reach out.
